<p class="lh-copy measure">
Sofar Sounds is a global movement which seeks to bring the magic back to live music by running gigs in interesting locations with the lineup kept secret till you arrive on the night. It's spread to over 300 cities worldwide and runs over 500 gigs per month.
</p>

<p class="lh-copy measure">
I worked in an agile team of 7 designers/developers/QA to iterate on and improve its ticketing website and events management platform.
</p>

Technology
</h2>

<p class="lh-copy measure">
The web application used the Ruby on Rails framework. I worked with JavaScript (jQuery, flightJS, React), SASS, HAML and Ruby.
</p>

<h2 class="f3 normal">
Events search
</h2>

<p class="lh-copy measure">
One of the first projects I worked on after joining was to build out the events index into a useful page for finding Sofar shows around the world. I paired with one of my teammates for the development of the search model with Ruby and used AJAX and browser geolocation to produce a searchable and filterable list of events worldwide. This saw a huge reduction in bounce rate for the page.

Performance
</h2>

<p class="lh-copy measure">
I focused on decreasing our websites load times, and using techniques to improve perceived performance.
</p>

<p class="lh-copy measure">
Key improvements included:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reducing our bloated 1.1mb CSS file to 36kb through refactoring.</li>

  <li>Improving Google Pagespeed insights score from 27/100 to 87/100 through more thoughtful loading strategies and refactoring.</li>

  <li>
  Benchmarking against our competitors to deliver a faster, smaller website and improve pages per session and other key metrics.
  </li>

  <li>
  Led the implementation of performance budgets to improve our approach to web perf throughout the whole tech team.
  </li>

</ul>
