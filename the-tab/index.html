            The Tab is an online news site which gets over 8 million unique visits per month. It's stories are written
            by its network of authors from over 100 universities across UK and the US, and a main editorial team based in London and New York.

            I work on its platform for writers and editors, Rosebud.

          <h2 class="mt3 mb2 regular h2">Technology</h2>
          <p class="line-height-4">
            The technology used is a server side of Node JS and Express which acts as a proxy api and also for
            server-rendering React views, image editing and authentication.
          </p>
          <p class="line-height-4">
            The client side is powered by React, Redux, React Router and various other libraries and tools.
          </p>
          <h2 class="mt3 mb2 regular h2">Writers</h2>
          <p class="line-height-4">
            For writers the platform's features include a rich text editor and a dashboard for viewing performance of their published
            stories or the status of their drafts.

            For editors Rosebud features tools for managing new writer applications, viewing and giving feedback on stories
            and collaborating on the stories which are produced.
          </p>
          <h2 class="mt3 mb2 regular h2">Performance</h2>
          <p class="line-height-4">
            Upon joining the project no attention had previously been paid to performance optimisations.
            I focused on reducing the bundle size of the application. First by replacing large monolithic libraries
            like Moment JS with smaller modular replacements which had the effect of reducing the bundle by 50%.
          </p>
          <p class="line-height-4">
            I then used Webpack's code-splitting functionality to split our bundle on a per route basis, which further
            reduced the amount of JavaScript being loaded and parsed per page and gave noticable improvements in
            time to interactive.
          </p>
          <p class="line-height-4">
            In addition to this focus on asset reduction, I also introduced a caching layer of Redis in front of our api
            requests, which resulted in a 10x decrease in response times and lead to a much snappier feeling experience.
